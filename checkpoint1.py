#1.2 Checkpoint task
#Write a Python class to represent a polynomial of the form:
#
#P(x)=∑i=0naixi=a0+a1x+a2x2+⋯+anxn
#where the coefficients ai are real numbers.
#
#Your class should include:
#
#A list instance variable to hold the coefficients of P(x).
#An __init__() method to set the values of the coefficients ai, which should be supplied as a list.
